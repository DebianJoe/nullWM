evilwm 1.1 by Ciaran Anscomb <evilwm@6809.org.uk>

evilwm is a minimalist window manager for the X Window System.

The name evil came from Stuart 'Stuii' Ford, who thinks that any software
I use must be evil and masochistic.  In reality, this window manager is
clean and easy to use.


FEATURES

 * No window decorations apart from a simple 1 pixel border.
 * No icons.
 * Good keyboard control, including repositioning and maximise toggles.
 * Solid window drags (optional - may be slow on old machines).
 * Virtual desktops.
 * Small binary size (even with everything turned on).
 * Reasonable EWMH support (though not yet fully compliant).
 * Configuration file read on startup.


INSTALLATION

Please see the file INSTALL for details on building evilwm.


STARTING EVILWM

If you're using a standard X desktop, you can start evilwm by just
changing your ~/.xinitrc file.  Here's a pretty standard sample file:

-----CUT HERE-----
[ -f $HOME/.Xdefaults ] && xrdb $HOME/.Xdefaults
xsetroot -solid \#400040 -cursor_name top_left_arrow
/usr/bin/evilwm -snap 10 &
exec xclock -digital -padding 2 -g -0+0
-----CUT HERE-----

Note that in this case 'xclock' is the magic process (the one that if
you kill it, your session dies).  You could change it around and have
evilwm be your magic process if you prefer.  Also note that it sets the
cursor shape and background colour with standard X tools (evilwm won't
do this for you - the tools already exist!).

If you use the GNOME session manager, you can configure it to
use evilwm as its window manager.  Run gconf-editor and set the
key /desktop/gnome/session/required_components/windowmanager
to "evilwm".


CONTROLS

You can use the mouse to manipulate windows either by click/dragging
the 1 pixel border, or by holding down Alt and doing so anywhere in the
client window.  The controls are:

Button 1       Move window.
Button 2       Resize window.
Button 3       Lower window.

Most keyboard controls are used by holding down Control and Alt, then
pressing a key.  Available functions are:

Return         Spawn new xterm.
Escape         Delete current window.
               This binding may be changed with -key.kill
Insert         Lower current window.
H, J, K, L     Move window left, down, up or right (16 pixels).
               Holding Shift resizes the window instead.
Y, U, B, N     Move window to top-left, top-right, bottom-left or
               bottom-right of screen.
I              Show information about current window.
Equals         Maximise current window vertically (toggle).
               Holding Shift toggles horizontal maximization.
X              Maximise current window (toggle).
D              Toggle visible state of docks (e.g., pagers and launch bars).

If compiled with virtual desktop support, these functions are also
available:

F              Fix or unfix window.
1 - 8          Switch virtual desktop.
Left           Previous virtual desktop.
Right          Next virtual desktop.
A              Switch to the most recently unmapped virtual desktop.
S              [dual-head xinerama only]
               Exchange the [two] currently visible virtual desktops.

In addition to the above, Alt+Tab can be used to cycle through windows
on screen.


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The original code base for this project was that of aewm by Decklin
Foster.  His code is very clean and, in later versions, very well
commented.  I'd recommend it if you want to learn more about window
manager theory (or indeed want title bars, etc ;).
