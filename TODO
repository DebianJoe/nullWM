Desired functionality for 1.1.x:
   * EWMH support, including:
        + Client control via root window messages.
   * A few things can probably cease to be compile-time options.
   * Better interoperation with Xinerama (David Flynn has some patches
     for this).
   * Option for new windows to tile as well as possible.

Desired functionality for 1.2.x:

   * EWMH compliance.
